//Welcome to Star Wars iterator practice!! .
//Just a quick note: I tried as hard as I could to keep this as accurate as possible. Please don't fight me if I got something wrong. üôèüèº
//ALSO!! 
//Everyone's birthdays are measrured in BBY! (Before the Battle of Yavin) 
// Because of this, the dates go backwards (like BC in our timeline), so the bigger the number, the earlier the critter was born!
// May the force be with you
