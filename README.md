# Welcome to Star Wars Iterator Practice!! 

#### These tests come in 4 spiciness levels measured with the Taco Bell Sauce gauge (mild, hot, fire and diablo)

### TO GET STARTED:

- Clone down this repo on your local machine
- CD into the local repo and run `npm install` in the command line
- Unskip the tests and try to pass!
- Use `npm test star-wars-iterator-practice-test.js` to run the tests

#### May the force be with you!

(this is my first try at making a test file from scratch with all of the dependencies, so please reach out to me if anything goes wrong!)
